# 2djscad
2D Javascript CAD
This a personal project, By creating an CAD application similar to AutoCAD or LibreCAD by Using only Javascript.
The goal is to know how powerfull Javascript is, and to understand its limit.

This version is still an early version. (https://mikaiaval.com/2DjsCAD_by_mikaiaval/)

The Project is still a Work in the Progress.

The version I have right now is more advanced than what you saw here. As a Free OpenSource, you can already use it even if many features mainly the core of the solver is a bit weak.

Key features
- Border with zoning
